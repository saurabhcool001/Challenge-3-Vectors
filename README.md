# Challenge-3-Vectors
With programming language/framework/engine you choose, “hard-code”(ie, not using existing libraries) a function/object that does vector operations including addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product, normalisation, getting magnitude and multiplication by a scalar. (Be aware of the inputs. Sometimes we need two vectors, sometimes one vector and one scalar, and sometimes only one vector.)

Make a simple game of a character crossing a river. The movement of the character can be controlled by a keyboard. When crossing the river, the movement of the character is influenced by the speed and direction of the river current. (Use the function/object you wrote in the previous challenge to realize this.)

Please submit commented code and a short video of the visual result.
